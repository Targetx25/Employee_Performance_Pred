The application is built with a Flask backend and provides a simple web interface for users to input data and receive a productivity prediction.

üöÄ Features
Web-Based Interface: An intuitive and stylish user interface for entering employee data.

Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a trained Random Forest or XGBoost model to make accurate predictions.

Real-Time Prediction: Instantly provides a productivity score and categorizes it as "High," "Medium," or "Low."

Deployed Application: The project is deployed and accessible online via Render.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Backend: Python, Flask

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, XGBoost

Deployment: Render, Gunicorn

Frontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS

üìÇ File Structure
The repository contains the following files:

app.py: The main Flask application file that contains the backend logic and serves the web interface.

best_productivity_model.pkl: The pre-trained machine learning model saved as a pickle file.

requirements.txt: A list of all the Python dependencies required to run the project.

Employee_Perf_Prediction.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook used for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.

garments_worker_productivity.csv: The dataset used to train the model.
